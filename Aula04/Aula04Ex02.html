		<h1>The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny - Lemon Demon</h1>
		<p>Old Godzilla was hopping around<br>
		Tokyo City like a big playground<br>
		When suddenly Batman burst from the shade<br>
		And hit Godzilla with a Batgrenade<br>
		Godzilla got pissed and began to attack<br>
		But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq<br>
		Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-Fu<br>
		When Aaron Carter came out of the blue<br>
		And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal<br>
		Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile<br>
		But before it could make it back to the Batcave<br>
		Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave<br>
		And took an AK-47 out from under his hat<br>
		And blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat<br>
		But he ran out of bullets and he ran away<br>
		Because Optimus Prime came to save the day</p>
		<p>This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny<br>
		Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see<br>
		And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be<br>
		This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny</p>
		<p>Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime<br>
		Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime<br>
		And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track<br>
		But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back<br>
		And Batman was injured, and trying to get steady<br>
		When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete<br>
		But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped<br>
		Indiana Jones took him out with his whip<br>
		Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind<br>
		And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find<br>
		'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed<br>
		And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist<br>
		Then he jumped in the air and did a somersault<br>
		While Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault<br>
		Onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air<br>
		Then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare</p>
		<p>This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny</p>
		<p>Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see<br>
		And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be<br>
		This is the ultimate showdown<br>
		Angels sang out an immaculate chorus<br>
		Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris<br>
		Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones<br>
		Into the crotch of Indiana Jones<br>
		Who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain<br>
		As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne<br>
		But Chuck saw through his clever disguise<br>
		And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs</p>
		<p>Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White<br>
		And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's black knight<br>
		And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie<br>
		And Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie<br>
		Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader<br>
		Lo-pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger<br>
		Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan<br>
		Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan</p>
		<p>All came out of nowhere lightning fast<br>
		And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass<br>
		It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw<br>
		With civilians looking on in total awe<br>
		The fight raged on for a century<br>
		Many lives were claimed, but eventually<br>
		The champion stood, the rest saw their better<br>
		Mr. Rogers in a bloodstained sweater</p>
		<p>This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny<br>
		Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see<br>
		And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be<br>
		This is the ultimate showdown<br>
		(The ultimate showdown)<br>
		This is the ultimate showdown<br>
		(The ultimate showdown)<br>
		This is the ultimate showdown<br>
		Of ultimate destiny</p>

		<p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
		I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
		She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
		In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<p>
		<p>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
		Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
		Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
		Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
		So much to do, so much to see<br>
		So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
		You'll never know if you don't go<br>
		You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
		<p>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
		Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
		And all that glitters is gold<br>
		Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
		<p>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
		You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>
		But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
		Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
		The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
		The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
		My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
		That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored</p>
		<p>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
		Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
		All that glitters is gold<br>
		Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
		<p>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
		Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid<br>
		And all that glitters is gold<br>
		Only shooting stars<p>
		<p>Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?<br>
		I need to get myself away from this place<br>
		I said, "Yup" what a concept<br>
		I could use a little fuel myself<br>
		And we could all use a little change</p>
		<p>Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
		Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
		Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
		Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
		So much to do, so much to see<br>
		So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
		You'll never know if you don't go (go!)<br>
		You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
		<p>Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
		Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
		And all that glitters is gold<br>
		Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
		<p>And all that glitters is gold<br>
		Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
